In this project Obesity Level Estimation Software based on Decision Trees article published by Eduardo De-La-Hoz-Correa, Fabio E. Mendoza-Palechor, Alexis De-La-Hoz-Manotas, Roberto C. Morales-Ortega and Sánchez Hernández Beatriz Adriana has been tried to replicated. Obesity has become a global epidemic that has doubled since 1980, authors handled that problem authors applied the SEMMA data mining methodology,  to select, explore and model the data set, and then three methods were selected: Decision trees, Bayesian networks (Naïve Bayes) and Logistic Regression, obtaining the best results with Decision trees based on the metrics: Precision, recall, TP Rate and FP Rate. Necessary information and the data itself can be achieved from: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>

## Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) (OMS, 2016), describes obesity and overweight as excessive fat accumulation in certain body areas that can be harmful to health, the number of people that suffers from obesity has doubled since 1980, and also in 2014 more than 1900 million adults, 18 years old or older, are suffering from alteration of their weight. Obesity is a public health problem worldwide and it can emerge in adults, teens, and children. 

Several authors have studied to analyze the disease and generate web tools to calculate the obesity level of a person, nevertheless, such tools are limited to the calculation of the body mass index, omitting relevant factors such as family background and time dedicated to. Based on this, the authors considered an intelligent tool was needed to be able to detect obesity levels in people more efficiently. In this study, volunteers were surveyed with a series of questions to identify their obesity level, considering several factors such as age, weight, sex, physical activity frequency, fast food intake, and others, that could help to describe the behavior of obese people. The methods and techniques used in the experimentation process of this study, refer to Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression. 

## Description of Methods
In this study, the stages based on the SEMMA methodology were performed. First, the dataset creation proceeded, from the information collected by the survey, as described in the below figure. After the dataset creation, the data have been validated, looking for missing values, atypical data, and the correlation level between variables, which is lower than 0.5, so can be sure that the stored data and the basis for the software implementation and the data mining methods are correct. Once the dataset was validated and prepared, the data mining techniques and methods were applied.
